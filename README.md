## CONCEPTUAL IDEA
	
	The purpose of this project is to create a procedural map and labyrinth generator.
	
	The algorithm used for this is not the best, but it emerges from the idea of
  looking at things from a different point of view.
  
  More specifically what the algorithm does is create a central cell and from
  that it generates adjacent to it in a random way, this allows the algorithm to be
  really fast but in exchange it forms quite circular maps (of Pangea style).
  
  For labyrinths, the only rule added is that any cell can not have more than 4
  adjacent cells.
